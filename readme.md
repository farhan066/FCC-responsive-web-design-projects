# Responsive Web Design Projects
These projects are part of my freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Each project is designed to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design.

## Projects

For the tribute page project, I created a page to honor a historical figure or celebrity of my choice. The page is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices and screen sizes.

The survey form project is a responsive form that collects user data through a series of questions. The form includes a variety of input types, such as text boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
